# Silksong - Community Edition

### Preamble

Silksong is an upcoming game by [Team Cherry](https://www.teamcherry.com.au/), and a sequel to their outstanding metroidvania game, [Hollow Knight](https://www.hollowknight.com).

Silksong was announced a long time ago with no news since, and due to this, the community around these two games has gone a bit .... crazy. 

On [silksong's subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/silksong), users have started posting as if the game has already been released, and about their favorite zones, bosses, NPCs and the like. Of course, this is all in jest and to confuse anyone not in on the joke, however these are people who have been around the Hollow Knight universe for a long time, and can reliably come up with mechanics and names that sound like they belong in the official game. 


### Reasoning

This repository is a compilation of all those fake-but-real-sounding ideas, in a small effort of putting together a roadmap for a community-created version of the unreleased Silksong game. 

_Note, this will not be a full game, just concepts and ideas, unless someone wants to make a Hollow Knight mod to implement them. In that case, please reach out._ ðŸ˜„
